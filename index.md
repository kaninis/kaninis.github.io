- A stable internet connection for downloading the file.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to download and run the application.

### 1. Visit the Releases Page
Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/kaninis/-Classification-with-Random-Forest/releases) to find the latest version of the software.

### 2. Download the Software
On the Releases Page, locate the latest version. Click on the link to download the application file. It will usually be named something like `Classification_Application.zip`. 

### 3. Extract Files
After downloading, locate the zip file in your Downloads folder. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or use your preferred extraction tool. Choose a destination folder where you want the files to be saved.

### 4. Open the Application
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Look for a file named `run_application.py`. Save the file in a location where you can easily find it, such as your Desktop.

### 5. Run the Application
Open a terminal or command prompt window. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you saved the `run_application.py` file. Once you're in the correct folder, type:

```
python run_application.py
```

Press Enter to run the application.

## 📊 Features
- **Customer Purchase Prediction:** Use historical data to forecast future purchases.
- **Fraud Detection:** Identify and assess possible fraudulent transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind for users with no coding experience.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes built-in charts and graphs to interpret results easily.

## 📚 How It Works
### Data Preparation
The application starts with loading your dataset. You can upload CSV files that contain your customer data. The software will handle the preliminary cleaning and preparation of the dataset automatically.

### Feature Engineering
Once the data is loaded, the tool applies feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset. This step is crucial for improving model accuracy.

### Model Training
The Random Forest algorithm then trains on your data. The model learns to make predictions based on patterns identified in the training data.

### Predictions & Evaluations
After training, you will see an interface where you can input new customer data. The application will provide you with predictions, along with an evaluation of model performance.

## 📊 Visualizations
By default, the application generates visual plots to help you understand your data better. Charts include:
- Histograms for data distribution.
- Scatter plots for relationships between variables.
- Confusion matrices for model evaluation.
